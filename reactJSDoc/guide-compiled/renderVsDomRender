- Component.render()

```
A component's render() method takes no arguments and returns the corresponding React element tree for that component. Component.render() gets called when the props or the state of a component change and shouldComponentUpdate() returns true. Based on the new props and state a new element React element tree is returned from the Component.render() method.
```

- ReactDOM.render()

```
The ReactDOM.render(element, container) method is a top-level API that takes a React element root of an element tree and a container DOM element as arguments. It then turns that passed React element into a corresponding DOM element (tree) and then mounts that element as a child in the container DOM element.
```
